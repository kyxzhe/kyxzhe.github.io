export const aboutIntro =
  'I\'m a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney, working with Marian-Andrei Rizoiu in the Behavioural Data Science Lab. My research looks at how information spreads online and how to keep machine learning models a little more robust when faced with the messiness of the real world.\n\nBefore the PhD, I studied at the University of Sydney (and somehow graduated with a University Medal). Teaching data science and ML became a favourite way to understand tough ideas—there\'s nothing like explaining a concept to realise where the gaps are.\n\nOutside academia I usually carry a film camera, hunt for the next coffee spot, or sweat it out at the gym. I rotate hobbies like archery, and I\'m always down to trade recommendations for diving, skydiving, or the best flat white in Sydney. If you want to chat about research, photography, or travel-fuelled ideas, feel free to reach out.\n\nIf you\'d like to talk about research, photography, or the eternal debate over the best flat white in Sydney, feel free to reach out!';
