export const aboutDescription =
  "I’m a PhD student at UTS (Behavioral Data Science Lab with Dr. Marian-Andrei Rizoiu) studying how information spreads online and how ML systems stay reliable in messy environments. Before grad school I graduated from the University of Sydney with a University Medal, taught data science/ML, and learned that explaining tough ideas is the best way to understand them. Off campus you’ll find me with a film camera, chasing flat whites, planning the next gym session, and picking up hobbies from archery to diving. Let’s talk about research, photography, or the best coffee in Sydney.";
